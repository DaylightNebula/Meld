# Meld
A custom bare-bones Kotlin Minecraft server implementation with the goal of being light-weight, fast and 
cross-platform.  Meld is designed with the goal of allowing for completely custom games using Minecraft as their 
engine.  Therefore, everything is customizable and the server itself just serves as an interface between the modules 
and the clients.

## Goals
1. Cross platform
2. Malleability + Modularity
3. Light As A Feather + Speeeeeeeeed

## Platforms
| Version | Support      |
|---------|--------------|
| Java    | Complete     |
| Bedrock | In Progress  |

## Modules
A core part of Meld is its modules system.  These are like the plugins you may have seen in Spigot or Paper.  However,
they are much more core and low-level in Meld (you may have noticed the standard modules in this project that handle 
everything from logins to player states).

### Module Setup

### Module Feature: Events
